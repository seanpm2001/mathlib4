# `trans` tactic

This implements the `trans` tactic, which can apply transitivity theorems with an optional middle
variable argument.

/-- Applies all `@[trans]` lemmas to the goal, optionally using `y?` as a "bridge" argument. Fails
if no lemma can be applied.

If a lemma of type `..hyps → x ∼ y → y ∼ z → x ∼ z` can be applied to the goal of type `x ∼ z`,
this returns `?g₁ : x ∼ y`, `?g₂ : y ∼ z`, and `?y` in that order, along with an array of any
unsolved explicit arguments in `hyps`. If `?y` was solved, we return `none`.

If the argument `y?` is provided as `none`, a new metavariable will be created for `y` if
necessary; otherwise the third component of the return value will be `none`.

If `userFacingGoals` is `true`, the returned goals will be renamed appropriately and changed from
`.natural` (the default) to `.syntheticOpaque`, except for `?y` (if present). This allows `?y` to
be assigned in the course of solving for the other goals. -/

/--
`trans` applies to a goal whose target has the form `t ~ u` where `~` is a transitive relation,
that is, a relation which has a transitivity lemma tagged with the attribute [trans].

* `trans s` replaces the goal with the two subgoals `t ~ s` and `s ~ u`.
* If `s` is omitted, then a metavariable is used instead.
